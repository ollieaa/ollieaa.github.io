      <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
      <p>Hi There! I am a London based junior web developer, recently graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Bootcamp. This was a three-month intensive course, covering a range of technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Python. <br/><br/> My previous career as a Pastry Chef required solid teamwork, attention to detail, and great workflow management. I am very eager to bring these skills to the table and continue growing at my first development position!</p>
